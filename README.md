# GENE_520_CRISPR_screen
*An example repo for Gene 520*

A README generally begins with a brief description of the software's purpose. 

## Installation

Often the first thing a user wants to know is 'How do I install this package?' 
Traditionally, this was an involved task. Nowadays, you should be able to install
high-level code (i.e. code that is not close-to-the-hardware) via a package 
manager. For python the installation might look like:
```bash
pip install <my_package>
```
For R you might use `Bioconductor`. 

## Usage

Next you may want to provide brief description of how your package is used. 
Greater Details can be provided in the **Tutorial** or **API**. 

## Workshop 3

Severals tasks we might be assigned 

1. Report the ~10~ most adaptive gene losses in NNK-induced malignant transformation
2. Plot a histogram of P-value abundances in the dataset
3. Compare how adaptation proceeds in
