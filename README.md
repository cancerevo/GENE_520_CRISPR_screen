# Installation

Often the first thing a user wants to know is 'How do I install this package?' 
Traditionally, this was a involved task. Nowadays, you should be able to install
high-level code (i.e. code that is not close-to-the-hardware) via a package 
manager. For python the installation might look like:
```bash
pip install <my_package>
```
For R you might use `Bioconductor`. 

# Usage

Next you may want to provide brief description of how your package is used. 
Greater Details can be provided in the *Tutorial* or *API*.
